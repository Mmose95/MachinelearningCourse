#Data info:
#A training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples; each having a size of 28 x 28 = 784 (concatenating the pixels).

#Exercises:

''' Exercise 1'''
# (a) choose three classes (5, 6 and 8) and then reduce dimension to 2;

''' Exercise 2'''
# (b) perform 3- class classification based on the generated 2-dimensional data.
